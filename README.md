## ‚û°Ô∏è Introduction to the Project
- The theme that we have agreed upon for this project is Food and Beverages. For this particular project, our group has decided to create a food donation website. GoodFood is a non-profit organization which aims to distribute nutritious food for those in need. In relation to Sustainable Goal Development, Goal 2: Zero Hunger, we have decided to create a platform where everyone is able to help with our cause as our motto is ‚Äúto care is to share‚Äù. With this initiative, it will come in a lot of handy for people to donate food to people that need food across the globe. Our website consists of five main pages which are home, register, login, donate, and about us page. The whole concept for this website is minimalist yet fresh and straight-to-the-point for easy navigation to all users. 
- For many donors, donating is a platform for knowing about the issues surrounding that particular need. Most people choose to learn about the issues, before donating, to get a wider perspective.

## ‚úÖ Objectives of the Project
- Our objective in creating this website is so that we can reach out to as many people across the globe to donate to the charity for the one who needs food the most. In addition to that, we are hoping that we can help other human beings no matter who and where they are. By doing so, we can reduce the hunger problem in this world. 
- Donating to the needy is a great way to improve the conditions in your neighborhood or community. Donating food to worthy people or organizations helps counter poverty, hunger and at the same time, it can improve harmony, friendliness, and trust among residents.
